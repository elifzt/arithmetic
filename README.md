Arithmetic Scala Project:
This Scala project contains a basic arithmetic library that performs arithmetic operations. It also includes a few examples to demonstrate how tests are written and executed.

Main Code:
The main project's Scala source code is located in the arithmetic/src/main/scala/arithmetic.scala file. This file contains functions for performing basic arithmetic operations.

Tests:
The project includes two different test suites to teach how to write and execute tests:

Arithmetic Test: 
This test suite is used to test arithmetic operations. Test files can be found in the arithmetic/src/main/arithmeticTest folder.

Higher-Order Test: 
This test suite is used to test more complex functions. Test files are also located in the arithmetic/src/main/arithmeticTest folder.

.gitignore:
The project uses a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and temporary files from version control. The .gitignore file is located at arithmetic/src/main/.gitignore.

build.sbt:
The project is configured using SBT (Scala Build Tool), which is Scala's build system. Project configuration settings can be found in the arithmetic/src/main/build.sbt file.
